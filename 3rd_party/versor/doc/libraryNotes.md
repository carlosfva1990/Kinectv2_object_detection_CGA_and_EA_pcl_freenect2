#Frame
ipx -> imaginary point pair in local coordinate's x direction
cxy -> circle on local xy plane
dll -> dual line exponentional representation of frame's current position and orientation

Generic
#Field
A 3d field is built from a CubicLattice, but could be built from any SpaceGroup
at(i,j,k)

#CubicLattice
A generic indexing mechanism for cubic tessellation of space
gridAt(i,j,k)

#Root
A generator of Coxeter reflection groups (feed in a list of generators)
